I worked on a Loan Approval Prediction project using the KNN algorithm in Python. 
In this project, I performed data cleaning, preprocessing, feature scaling, and trained a KNN model to predict whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on user input. 
This helped me understand how distance-based algorithms work and why scaling is important in machine learning. Learning step by step
